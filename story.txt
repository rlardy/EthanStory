It rains every day where Qwerty lives. Perched on a windowsill, his bowl overlooks the harbor from thirteen stories up. Qwerty is smart. The human in the apartment returns home at 5:00PM every single day and opens the window near the fish bowl, never with concern that one day Qwerty might escape. At 6:00PM every day, the human takes a nap and Qwerty, like clockwork, swims back and forth, inching the bowl closer to freedom. At 7:00PM today, Qwerty's bowl, dangling halfway between freedom and captivity, fell thirteen stories before safely landing a puddle. Qwerty knew this would happen because his owner's lack of interest meant living in a plastic bowl that wouldn't shatter when it fell. What Qwerty failed to calculate, however, was how to reach the harbor when his bowl landed upside down, five hundred feet from shore. However, for the past several years Qwerty had been perfecting the language used by the Pelicans that swarm the harbor everyday and even befriended a few. He began to make the cry for help which he had been told would be his salvation. Unbeknownst to him, the call the pelicans had taught him was actually the call pelicans used to alert all other pelicans that food is in this location. Within a few seconds, dozens of pelicans were circling overhead with a few eventually making some diveing attempts to break the plastic bowl containing Qwerty. Fortunately, the plastic was strong enough to endure the powerful jaws of the pelicans and instead shot Qwerty in whichever direction.
Qwerty was very nervous, he didn't know what to do. The shore is 500 feet away, he tried to talk with pelicans and make them calm, he tried every Pelican's words that he know, fortunately, the Pelicans stopped to attack him.
